    <h1>Causes of Water Scarcity</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
   <div>
    <p>Water scarcity is a growing global challenge driven by various interconnected factors. Here's a detailed overview of the key contributors to water scarcity:
    </p>

    <li>
        <div>
           <h3> Climate Change:</h3>
           <ul type="square">
<li><h4>Altered Precipitation Patterns:</h4>
    <p> Climate change is causing shifts in rainfall patterns, leading to more intense and erratic rainfall in some areas and prolonged droughts in others. This disrupts the balance of water availability.</p></li>

<br>
     <li> 
        <h4>Rising Temperatures:</h4>
        <p>Increased temperatures contribute to higher evaporation rates, reducing the availability of surface water and stressing water resources.

    <li>
        <div>
            <h3>Over-Extraction and Unsustainable Use:</h3>
            <ul type="square">
            <li><h4>Groundwater Depletion:</h4>
            <p>Excessive pumping of groundwater for irrigation, industrial use, and drinking water has led to the depletion of aquifers in many regions. When extraction exceeds recharge rates, aquifers become non-renewable.</p></li>

            <li>
                <h4>Surface Water Overuse:</h4>
                <p> Rivers and lakes are often over-allocated for agricultural, industrial, and municipal purposes. This excessive withdrawal disrupts aquatic ecosystems and diminishes available water.
                </p>

<li>
    <div>
        <h3>Pollution:</h3>
        <ul type="square">
        <li><h4>Contaminated Water Sources:</h4>
        <p>Pollution from agriculture, industrial discharges, untreated sewage, and runoff from urban areas contaminates water sources. Polluted water is unsafe for consumption, necessitating treatment and reducing available clean water.</p></li>
